# Sapling — visual style bible (v2: low-detail anime)

**Decided by the founder, 2026-07-19** (direct instruction to the steward:
"not a realistic theme — a low detail anime theme"). This supersedes the v1
photoreal-fantasy look used in the first trial clips and shot lists. Style is
a taste axis (R4): this file is the founder's call, executed by the steward;
amending it is a founder edit like any taste change.

## The look, in one block

Every generation prompt carries this style block verbatim (then scene
specifics on top):

```
Hand-drawn 2D anime style, low detail: flat cel-shaded colors, bold clean
linework, minimal shading (single shadow tone), simplified shapes, soft
watercolor-wash backgrounds with large empty areas, gentle pastel-leaning
palette, expressive minimal faces. No photorealism, no 3D render look, no
heavy texture. 9:16 vertical, no text.
```

## Why low detail (beyond taste)

- **Consistency is cheaper.** Simple character shapes survive across shots
  and across model providers far better than photoreal faces do — the
  continuity clauses actually hold.
- **Budget models close the gap.** Flat-color anime is where Wan/Hailuo-class
  pricing competes with Veo-class output; the D8 bake-off should be re-judged
  in this style (noted in DECISIONS.md).
- **The overlay belongs.** The system's wireframe/debug layer reads as
  *native* against flat cel shading — UI lines over UI-adjacent art — instead
  of clashing with photographic footage.

## Character model sheet (anime terms — paste what a shot needs)

- **The sapling:** a tiny, almost mascot-simple tree — thin curved trunk, one
  or two oversized expressive leaves; its acting is entirely leaf angle and
  timing. Never a face, never eyes; expression is *pose*.
- **The scavenger (goblin):** small and round, enormous ears that act like a
  second face, one broken tusk, huge expressive eyes, patchwork cloak in
  faded greens and browns. Cartoonishly bad at hiding.
- **The farmer:** broad, squarish silhouette; straw hat; three lines can draw
  his whole face; permanently unimpressed posture; clay jug.
- **The assessor:** a thin vertical line of a man; dust-grey robes, chained
  ledger, quill stub; moves like a metronome, drawn with ruler-straight edges.
- **The magistrate:** sharp angular silhouette in dark robes of office; a
  seal on a chain; a face drawn for one raised eyebrow.
- **Patrol guards:** mismatched armor, one bark clipboard; round, harmless
  shapes.

## Palette anchors (per time of day)

- **Dawn/morning:** warm peach and gold washes, long soft shadows.
- **Midday:** high flat greens, pale blue-white sky, minimal shadow.
- **Dusk/hook scenes:** amber into indigo; silhouettes read before faces.
- **Night/full moon:** deep indigo with silver rim light, flat and quiet.
- **Underground/sensing:** near-black with bioluminescent teal and green —
  glowing root filaments as clean neon lines.
- **The overlay window:** the world reduces to neon-green vector wireframe on
  near-black — grass as lattice, objects as labeled low-poly outlines. (This
  is the one place "low detail" becomes literal geometry.)

## What stays true from v1

Shot content, camera direction, beat timing, the no-burned-in-text rule, and
all continuity facts (props, staging, arrival choreography) are unchanged —
only the rendering style moved. Post still adds captions, overlays, and VO.

## Status of v1 footage

The node-001 trial clips (Veo/Flow, photoreal, beats 1/2/4) remain archived
with full provenance at `/trials/` and in the 001 T3 leaf — they are v1
evidence, not canon style. Remaking them in v2 anime is a founder render
session (free tier) or a D8-funded run; the rewritten prompts sit ready in
`nodes/001-capability-inventory/shots.md`.

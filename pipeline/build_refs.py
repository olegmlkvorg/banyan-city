"""Reference voices for Chatterbox cloning — identity continuity across
the engine swap. Each voice in the genome's voices.yaml cast (plus the
narrator and default pool) gets ~10s of kokoro speech saved to
~/.cache/banyan-tts/cb-refs/<voice>.wav; synth_vo --engine chatterbox
clones from these, so the tree still sounds like the tree (R4: the cast
is the founder's; this preserves it rather than recasting).

Runs under the kokoro TTS venv:

# One shared passage made every clone converge toward the same read — the

# "voices are mixed up"). Per-voice character text + the cast's own speeds
# + a small pitch offset widen the separation the clone locks onto. The
# narrator bm_fable stays untouched — that voice is the tree's released
# identity. Offsets are semitones, applied losslessly via resample+tempo.
